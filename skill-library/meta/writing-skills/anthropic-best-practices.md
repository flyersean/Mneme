# Skill Authoring Best Practices

> Learn how to write effective Skills that agents can discover and use successfully.

Good Skills are concise, well-structured, and tested with real usage. This guide provides practical authoring decisions to help you write Skills that agents can discover and use effectively.

## Core principles

### Concise is key

The context window is a public good. Your Skill shares the context window with everything else your agent needs to know, including:

* The system prompt
* Conversation history
* Other Skills' metadata
* Your actual request

Not every token in your Skill has an immediate cost. At startup, only the metadata (name and description) from all Skills is pre-loaded. Agents read SKILL.md only when the Skill becomes relevant, and read additional files only as needed. However, being concise in SKILL.md still matters: once an agent loads it, every token competes with conversation history and other context.

**Default assumption**: Agents are already very smart

Only add context agents don't already have. Challenge each piece of information:

* "Does the agent really need this explanation?"
* "Can I assume the agent knows this?"
* "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

**Good example: Concise** (approximately 50 tokens):

````markdown
## Extract PDF text

Use pdfplumber for text extraction:

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```
````

**Bad example: Too verbose** (approximately 150 tokens):

```markdown
## Extract PDF text

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format that contains
text, images, and other content. To extract text from a PDF, you'll need to
use a library. There are many libraries available for PDF processing, but we
recommend pdfplumber because it's easy to use and handles most cases well.
First, you'll need to install it using pip. Then you can use the code below...
```

The concise version assumes the agent knows what PDFs are and how libraries work.

### Set appropriate degrees of freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability.

**High freedom** (text-based instructions):

Use when:
* Multiple approaches are valid
* Decisions depend on context
* Heuristics guide the approach

Example:
```markdown
## Code review process

1. Analyze the code structure and organization
2. Check for potential bugs or edge cases
3. Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
4. Verify adherence to project conventions
```

**Medium freedom** (pseudocode or scripts with parameters):

Use when:
* A preferred pattern exists
* Some variation is acceptable
* Configuration affects behavior

Example:
````markdown
## Generate report

Use this template and customize as needed:

```python
def generate_report(data, format="markdown", include_charts=True):
    # Process data
    # Generate output in specified format
    # Optionally include visualizations
```
````

**Low freedom** (specific scripts, few or no parameters):

Use when:
* Operations are fragile and error-prone
* Consistency is critical
* A specific sequence must be followed

Example:
````markdown
## Database migration

Run exactly this script:

```bash
python scripts/migrate.py --verify --backup
```

Do not modify the command or add additional flags.
````

**Analogy**: Think of the agent as a robot exploring a path:

* **Narrow bridge with cliffs on both sides**: There's only one safe way forward. Provide specific guardrails and exact instructions (low freedom). Example: database migrations that must run in exact sequence.
* **Open field with no hazards**: Many paths lead to success. Give general direction and trust the agent to find the best route (high freedom). Example: code reviews where context determines the best approach.

### Test with all models you plan to use

Skills act as additions to models, so effectiveness depends on the underlying model. Test your Skill with all the models you plan to use it with.

**Testing considerations by model:**
* **Fast/cheap models**: Does the Skill provide enough guidance?
* **Standard models**: Is the Skill clear and efficient?
* **Most capable models**: Does the Skill avoid over-explaining?

What works perfectly for a capable model might need more detail for a cheaper one. If you plan to use your Skill across multiple models, aim for instructions that work well with all of them.

## Skill structure

### Naming conventions

Use consistent naming patterns to make Skills easier to reference and discuss. We recommend using **gerund form** (verb + -ing) for Skill names, as this clearly describes the activity or capability the Skill provides.

**Good naming examples (gerund form)**:
* "Processing PDFs"
* "Analyzing spreadsheets"
* "Managing databases"
* "Testing code"
* "Writing documentation"

**Acceptable alternatives**:
* Noun phrases: "PDF Processing", "Spreadsheet Analysis"
* Action-oriented: "Process PDFs", "Analyze Spreadsheets"

**Avoid**:
* Vague names: "Helper", "Utils", "Tools"
* Overly generic: "Documents", "Data", "Files"
* Inconsistent patterns within your skill collection

Consistent naming makes it easier to:
* Reference Skills in documentation and conversations
* Understand what a Skill does at a glance
* Organize and search through multiple Skills
* Maintain a professional, cohesive skill library

### Writing effective descriptions

The `description` field enables Skill discovery and should include both what the Skill does and when to use it.

**Always write in third person**. The description is injected into the system prompt, and inconsistent point-of-view can cause discovery problems.

  * **Good:** "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
  * **Avoid:** "I can help you process Excel files"
  * **Avoid:** "You can use this to process Excel files"

**Be specific and include key terms**. Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.

Each Skill has exactly one description field. The description is critical for skill selection: agents use it to choose the right Skill from potentially 100+ available Skills. Your description must provide enough detail for an agent to know when to select this Skill, while the rest of SKILL.md provides the implementation details.

Effective examples:

**PDF Processing skill:**

```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Excel Analysis skill:**

```yaml
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, generate charts. Use when analyzing Excel files, spreadsheets, tabular data, or .xlsx files.
```

**Git Commit Helper skill:**

```yaml
description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
```

Avoid vague descriptions like these:

```yaml
description: Helps with documents
```

```yaml
description: Processes data
```

```yaml
description: Does stuff with files
```

### Progressive disclosure patterns

SKILL.md serves as an overview that points agents to detailed materials as needed, like a table of contents in an onboarding guide.

**Practical guidance:**

* Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance
* Split content into separate files when approaching this limit
* Use the patterns below to organize instructions, code, and resources effectively

#### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references

````markdown
---
name: PDF Processing
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, and merges documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
---

# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

## Advanced features

**Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
**API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
**Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns
````

Agents load FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.

#### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization

For Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context. When a user asks about sales metrics, the agent only needs to read sales-related schemas, not finance or marketing data. This keeps token usage low and context focused.

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline, accounts)
    ├── product.md (API usage, features)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

````markdown SKILL.md
# BigQuery Data Analysis

## Available datasets

**Finance**: Revenue, ARR, billing → See [reference/finance.md](reference/finance.md)
**Sales**: Opportunities, pipeline, accounts → See [reference/sales.md](reference/sales.md)
**Product**: API usage, features, adoption → See [reference/product.md](reference/product.md)
**Marketing**: Campaigns, attribution, email → See [reference/marketing.md](reference/marketing.md)

## Quick search

Find specific metrics using grep:

```bash
grep -i "revenue" reference/finance.md
grep -i "pipeline" reference/sales.md
grep -i "api usage" reference/product.md
```
````

#### Pattern 3: Conditional details

Show basic content, link to advanced content:

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents

Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents

For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

Agents read REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.

### Avoid deeply nested references

Agents may partially read files when they're referenced from other referenced files. When encountering nested references, an agent might use commands like `head -100` to preview content rather than reading entire files, resulting in incomplete information.

**Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md**. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md to ensure agents read complete files when needed.

**Bad example: Too deep**:

```markdown
# SKILL.md
See [advanced.md](advanced.md)...

# advanced.md
See [details.md](details.md)...

# details.md
Here's the actual information...
```

**Good example: One level deep**:

```markdown
# SKILL.md

**Basic usage**: [instructions in SKILL.md]
**Advanced features**: See [advanced.md](advanced.md)
**API reference**: See [reference.md](reference.md)
**Examples**: See [examples.md](examples.md)
```

### Structure longer reference files with table of contents

For reference files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top. This ensures agents can see the full scope of available information even when previewing with partial reads.

**Example**:

```markdown
# API Reference

## Contents
- Authentication and setup
- Core methods (create, read, update, delete)
- Advanced features (batch operations, webhooks)
- Error handling patterns
- Code examples

## Authentication and setup
...

## Core methods
...
```

Agents can then read the complete file or jump to specific sections as needed.

## Workflows and feedback loops

### Use workflows for complex tasks

Break complex operations into clear, sequential steps. For particularly complex workflows, provide a checklist that the agent can copy into its response and check off as it progresses.

**Example 1: Research synthesis workflow** (for Skills without code):

````markdown
## Research synthesis workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Research Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Read all source documents
- [ ] Step 2: Identify key themes
- [ ] Step 3: Cross-reference claims
- [ ] Step 4: Create structured summary
- [ ] Step 5: Verify citations
```

**Step 1: Read all source documents**

Review each document in the `sources/` directory. Note the main arguments and supporting evidence.

**Step 2: Identify key themes**

Look for patterns across sources. What themes appear repeatedly? Where do sources agree or disagree?

**Step 3: Cross-reference claims**

For each major claim, verify it appears in the source material. Note which source supports each point.

**Step 4: Create structured summary**

Organize findings by theme. Include:
- Main claim
- Supporting evidence from sources
- Conflicting viewpoints (if any)

**Step 5: Verify citations**

Check that every claim references the correct source document. If citations are incomplete, return to Step 3.
````

This example shows how workflows apply to analysis tasks that don't require code. The checklist pattern works for any complex, multi-step process.

**Example 2: PDF form filling workflow** (for Skills with code):

````markdown
## PDF form filling workflow

Copy this checklist and check off items as you complete them:

```
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze the form (run analyze_form.py)
- [ ] Step 2: Create field mapping (edit fields.json)
- [ ] Step 3: Validate mapping (run validate_fields.py)
- [ ] Step 4: Fill the form (run fill_form.py)
- [ ] Step 5: Verify output (run verify_output.py)
```

**Step 1: Analyze the form**

Run: `python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf`

This extracts form fields and their locations, saving to `fields.json`.

**Step 2: Create field mapping**

Edit `fields.json` to add values for each field.

**Step 3: Validate mapping**

Run: `python scripts/validate_fields.py fields.json`

Fix any validation errors before continuing.

**Step 4: Fill the form**

Run: `python scripts/fill_form.py input.pdf fields.json output.pdf`

**Step 5: Verify output**

Run: `python scripts/verify_output.py output.pdf`

If verification fails, return to Step 2.
````

This example shows the checklist pattern applied to a code-based workflow. Each step has a clear command, expected output, and failure handling.
